   1) ./run.sh  - Download image 'brainchildralph/work:bbb' and 
      create container named 'bbb'. 
   
   2) ./start.sh - Start the container. It won't run under 
      'interactive' mode, but you can modify 'start.sh' with '-i'
      flag. 

   3) ./bash.sh - It will execute 'bash' for container with interactive
      mode.  

   4) ./share - This folder is shared with container. 

   *) The 'rm.sh' will remove the container but not image. Before you
      remove the container, please run 'stop.sh' to make sure the 
      container is not running. If you want to clean image also, run 
      script 'rmi.sh'.
